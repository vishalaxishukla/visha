student building intelligent physical systems at the intersection of robotics, embedded control.

I focus on designing and integrating real-world hardware systems where mechanical structure, sensor input, and control logic work together.

## Core Areas
- Robotics and transformation mechanics
- Servo motor integration and calibration
- Embedded system coordination
- ML-assisted safety systems

## Selected Projects
### Arduino Transformer
Mechanically transforming robot switching between car and humanoid modes.  
Worked on structural design, motor integration, synchronization planning, and system testing.

### NITRA – Night-time Intelligent Traffic Risk Alert
ML-based safety system using LDR sensors and Python to detect risky light patterns in low-visibility driving conditions.  
Contributed to project coordination, sensor setup, and implementation logic support.
